Guard::RubyCritic is a tool that uses [RubyCritic](https://github.com/whitesmith/rubycritic) to detect and report smells in Ruby code in real-time.

Installation
------------

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "guard-rubycritic"
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Next, generate a default `Guardfile` in your root directory:

```bash
$ guard init rubycritic
```

Commit the changes to the Gemfile and Guardfile, and you're good to go.

Usage
-----

Change your `Guardfile` to your heart's content and start it with the following command:

```bash
$ guard
```

Each time you save a file, that file will be analysed and its report will be available at `YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT/tmp/rubycritic/current_file.html`.
